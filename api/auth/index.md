# `/auth`
Handles authentication for users using tokens.

## Variables
- `ph`: Hashed password using SHA256.
- `dt`: Device token generated by API, stored in local storage of device.
- `pd`: Hashed password concated with device token, then hashed using SHA1. Used directly used to generate tokens and this is stored in local storage of the device.
- `rt`: UNIX Epoch rounded to 10 seconds on the client side and 20 seconds on the server side. This ensures any stolen tokens are only vaild for a short period of time.
- `t`: The final token, produced by concating and hashing (with SHA1) the `pd` and `rt`, then concating the `dt` to that hash. Once generated the token is valid for 10-20 seconds.
